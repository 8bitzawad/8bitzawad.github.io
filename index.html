<h1>I AM A GAMER. Not because I don't have a life but because I choose to have many. Gaming is my DNA and I am never alone. I have the gamer community with me. DON'T BE SURPRISED, gaming has its own benefit. IT HELPS IMPROVE ATTENTION, FOCUS AND REACTION TIME. Games also have motivational benefit because they induce positive mood states. They also have social benefits because gamers are able to translate the prosocial skills that they learn from co-playing or multiplayer gameplay to "peer and family relations outside the gaming environment." I did not make this up. REALLY. This was from an article entitled "The Benefits of Playing Video Games". Gaming also teaches YOU ABOUT LIFE. When you failed a mission, pick yourself up and try again. When things are getting out of control, press the pause button. Resume when you have gathered yourself. SO, ARE YOU GAME ENOUGH?
